To run it, first run
### `npm i`

and then
### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

FEATURES:
1. Filter by searching by name
2. Filter by selecting continent
3. Animations and shadow effects

PS:
I could not finish the dark theme feature as I am very low on availabe time but I believe my tech skills can be duly judged by the quality of work I did to implement these features.

Regards & Thanks,
Abhishek Kumar
